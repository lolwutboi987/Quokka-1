# Quokka-1
Custom CNC for California High School
## Why Quokka?
The quokka-one is a research project pioneering the world of cnc milling/manufacting at the open-source scale. While other open-source CNC mills like milo, or the openbuilds mini-mill paved the way for open source cnc machining, Quokka expands upon the scale at which open source cnc machining operates at, as Quokka will be the first open-source 3 axis cnc mill in this capability category. This machine will be a prototype using the frame of a davinci 1419, a simple i3 style frame using 80160 extrusions and cast steel sideplates.
